        <p>Thank you for purchasing the Laravel PayHere plugin. We appreciate your business and strive to provide high-quality digital products. However, please note that all sales are final. We do not offer refunds or exchanges for any digital products purchased through our website.</p>

        <h2 class="my-6 text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl">No Refunds</h2>
        <p>Due to the nature of digital products and the fact that they cannot be "returned," we do not offer refunds or exchanges for any reason.</p>

        <h2 class="my-6 text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl">Exceptions</h2>
        <p>In rare cases, exceptions may be made at our sole discretion under the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul class="my-2 list-disc pl-10">
            <li>If the digital product was not delivered as described.</li>
            <li>If the product is proven to be defective and cannot be fixed within a reasonable timeframe.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="my-6 text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl">How to Request an Exception</h2>
        <p>If you believe you qualify for an exception, please contact us within 14 days of purchase. Provide your order number, a detailed description of the issue, and any relevant information that can help us evaluate your claim.</p>
