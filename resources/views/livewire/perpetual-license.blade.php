            A perpetual fallback license is a license that allows you to use a specific version of software forever, even if you don't renew the license yearly to get access to the latest version.
        </p>
        <p class="my-6">
            When purchasing Laravel PayHere, you immediately get a perpetual fallback license for the exact version available at the time. You can use this version as long as your operating system supports the app.
        </p>
        <p class="my-6">
            Every Laravel PayHere license includes access to updates for one year. After that, you can decide to go back to your perpetual fallback license or renew your license to get access to the latest version. On renewal, we bump your perpetual license to the version that is available at the time of renewal.
